Umple is a suite of technologies for:

* Modeling software using data models (class diagrams), state models and others; the models can be edited textually or graphically
* Analysing models (finding errors, linting)
* Embedding action code in  models using Java, Python, PhP, C++ and Rubyu
* Organizing code using a variety of separation of concerns mechanisms (traits, mixins, mixsets, aspects)
* Generating code in ny of the above languages to create libraries or complete systems
* Generating diagrams, examples, and many other artifacts
